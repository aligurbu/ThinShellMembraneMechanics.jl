# ThinShellMembraneMechanics.jl: Thin shell mechanics with Kirchhoff-Love kinematics code

- This code was developed for part of [my dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355033649_Simulations_of_Red_Blood_Cell_Flow_by_Boundary_Integral_Methods) to simulate red blood cell flow using boundary integral methods.
- This repository contains the code for the concepts and examples presented in Chapter 3 for computing the red blood cell membrane force field using the spherical harmonics basis functions in the framework of thin shell mechanics with Kirchhoff-Love kinematics.
